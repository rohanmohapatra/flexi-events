# Flexi-Events: Virtual Events Platform

Flexi-Events’ goal is to create a platform where content creators, tech enthusiasts, and companies can host webinars and virtual conferences with a click of a button. This is a one-stop solution to create a single-day/multi-day event, search and register for events and increase your knowledge.

During Covid, many companies released video-conferencing tools to meet virtually. Let’s say, a professor wants to give a talk on NoSQL. The professor would have to create a Google Meet Link and send the link to the participants. With Flexi-Events, you can set up the event with any “video-conferencing” tool and we will handle the registrations and everything.
